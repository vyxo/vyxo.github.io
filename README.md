# Vyxo
## About
I am just *another* web developer in this universe. Other than a bit of **JavaScript** knowledge, I am pretty useless. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/vyxo/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/T53wbpsScu) and some other sites!

## Support
If you liked this website or you just want to be nice feel free to follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/vyxo/) and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/T53wbpsScu) server. I appreciate new members!

> I might start a YouTube channel soon. It doesn't sound like a bad idea...

## Usage
If you plan on using the JS or CSS of this site **please give credit** because it took a *lot* of work to figure out the smooth scrolling, loading effects, hover effects, and animations.
